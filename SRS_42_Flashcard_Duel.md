## Project 42: Flashcard Duel — Multiplayer Quiz (Education)

### 1. Project Description
Flashcard Duel gamifies the study experience by turning traditional flashcards into real-time, competitive multiplayer matches. Two players connect, and race to answer multiple-choice or short-answer questions. It's designed to make rote memorization (like vocabulary or anatomy) highly engaging through competition.

### 2. Core Scope
The application relies heavily on WebSockets for real-time multiplayer synchronization, matchmaking logic, and a dynamic deck creation system.
